## Who is the best player?

I want to find out the best basketball player in 2020-2021 nba games with the data of the games. 

#### Here are some designs:

1. I have some advanced data, this can helps to find out the best players as the label.
2. I have enough basic data of the game. I can find out what kind of data is the most important.
3. I can try to predict the best player with these basic data.
4. I can compare the basic data perferred player with the advanced data preferred player
5. I can give some answers about who was the best player in 2020-2021
